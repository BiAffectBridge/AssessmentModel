/// An ``InputItem`` describes a "part" of a ``Question`` representing a single answer.
///
/// For example, if a question is "what is your name" then the input items may include "given name" and "family name"
/// where separate text fields are used to allow the participant to enter their first and last name, and the question
/// may also include a list of titles from which to choose.
///
/// In another example, the input item could be a single cell in a list that shows the possible choices for a question.
/// In essence, this is akin to a single cell in a table view though the actual implementation may differ.
