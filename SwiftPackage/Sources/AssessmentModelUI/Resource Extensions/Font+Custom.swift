 The static font methods and ivars defined within this module are all intentionally internal so as not to risk namespace
 clashes with other assessments. We may, at some point, create a "Design System" library for handling fonts, images,
 and colors but for now, it is assumed that all user-facing UI is contained within the scope of a repo or repos owned
 wholly by the content creators. - syoung 05/13/2021
